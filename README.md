# Recipeasy - AI Recipe Recommendation App
[<img src="./recipeasy.png">]

Recipeasy is an AI-powered recipe recommendation app that suggests personalized recipes based on your saved preferences. It allows users to save their favorite recipes and uses that data to generate better future recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Get recipe suggestions based on your taste preferences and past saved recipes.
- **Save Recipes**: Save your favorite recipes to your profile for future access.
- **Personalized Suggestions**: The more you interact with the app, the more accurate the recommendations will become.
- **User Profile**: Each user has their own profile that stores saved recipes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (TailwindCSS)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase (or any other database you plan to use)
- **AI/Recommendation Engine**: Python (using libraries like TensorFlow or Scikit-Learn for AI/ML if applicable)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM/Yarn
- MongoDB or any database of your choice (for storing user data and recipes)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipeasy.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd recipeasy
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys):
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
    - Add necessary configuration (example for MongoDB):
        ```
        DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/recipeasy
        ```

5. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users can register and log in to create their profiles.
2. **Recipe Recommendations**: Once logged in, users can see AI-powered recipe recommendations based on their preferences.
3. **Save Recipes**: Users can save their favorite recipes to their profile.
4. **Profile Page**: Users can view their saved recipes in their profile and continue receiving personalized suggestions.

## AI Recommendation Engine

The app uses an AI-based recommendation engine that takes into account:
- **User Preferences**: What types of recipes a user has saved before.
- **Recipe Features**: Ingredients, cuisine, cooking difficulty, etc.
- **AI Model**: The AI model suggests recipes based on user behavior and recipe features. The model learns over time and becomes more accurate with each interaction.

## Future Features

- Integration with third-party recipe APIs for a broader recipe database.
- Nutrition information for each recipe.
- Meal planning feature to suggest recipes based on dietary needs and preferences.
- Mobile app for Recipeasy.
